# Demonstrating Group Theory Concepts with the Rubik's Cube

The code in this repository was created with the language Java-Processing. The base of the cube was created following the [tutorial](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/142.1-rubiks-cube.html) by TheCodingTrain. 

**How to use**
You will need to download [Processing](https://processing.org/) to run this project. Once you have downloaded the software, download the code in this repository. When opening the project in the Processing environment, press the play button at the top left to launch the cube. 

**Functionality** 
You can move the cube just like any other cube, (clockwise and counter-clockwise when the red side is facing the user – bottom side is the same as the top side, back side is the same as the front side)

Keypress [r] – Moves the right side of the cube clockwise
Keypress [R] – Moves the right side of the cube counter-clockwise
Keypress [l] – Moves the left side of the cube clockwise
Keypress [L] – Moves the left side of the cube counter-clockwise
Keypress [u]  – Moves the top side of the cube clockwise
Keypress [U] – Moves the top side of the cube counter-clockwise
Keypress [f] – Moves the front side of the cube clockwise
Keypress [F] – Moves the front side of the cube counter-clockwise
Keypress [b] – Moves the back side of the cube clockwise
Keypress [B] – Moves the back side of the cube counter-clockwise
Keypress [d] – Moves the bottom side of the cube clockwise
Keypress [D] – Moves the bottom side of the cube counter-clockwise

Keypress [p] – Resets the cube to solved state
